Multicorn-queries
-----------------

A set of objects to describe queries such as map, filter, reduce; and a
pure-python `executor` to run these queries on an iterable of mappings.

The idea of separating the query description and its execution (versus just
using generator-comprehensions, sorted() and itertools.groupby()) is that
a different executor could translate a query (or part of it) eg. to SQL
and defer to a faster database.

See tests.py for an usage example.
