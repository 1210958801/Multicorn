Unified query/expression objects
--------------------------------

An expression represents an “item”. An “item” does not have to be an
Item instance (but it can).

An actual value is obtained by executing/evaluating an expression against a
base item, typically the sequence of all Items in a Corn.


Expressions represent one of:
    A literal value
    A sequence of items
    ??? A variable


`All`:
    Represents the unmodified base item. (It is named so as the base item
    is a sequence of Items in Multicorn.)

On expressions representing sequences:
    Returning a new sequence:
        .filter(item -> boolean)
        .map(item -> new item)
        .sort(item -> sort key)
        ???  .groupby(item -> grouping key)
        [slice]

    .reduce((acc, item -> new acc), initial acc)
        or  .reduce(pre-defined marker such as Sum)
    [index]   (Maybe?)
