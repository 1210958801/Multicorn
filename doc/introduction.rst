============

Multicorn is a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension meant to make `Foreign Data Wrapper`_
development easy, by allowing the programmer to use the Python programming
language.

Ok, but why should I care ?
---------------------------

- Multicorn allows you to access any data source in your PostgreSQL database.
- You can leverage the full power of SQL to query your data sources
- Every tool you use for SQL can be reused with those datasources (think about
  an ORM, BI tool...)
