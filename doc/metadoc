Meta documentation
##################

The website should *be* the doc.


Introduction (front page)
=========================

We have about 5 seconds of attention here. We need to tell what Multicorn is
and convince the reader that it is great and they need it.


Quickstart
----------

If possible, show some working in very few lines. A “hello world”, conceptually.


Tutorial
========

Now we have the reader’s interest. Show how to install and get started.
Cover what Multicorn can do in breadth but not in depth, narrative style.
No need to be comprehensive, even in breadth.


Writing a new /corn/
--------------------

* Minimal interface
* How to optimize, helpers for this


API reference
=============

Cover every module, function, class, attribute, method and such. Mostly from
docstrings but not only. Include every built-in “corn”. Detail what is 
“optimized” (eg. translated into SQL) and what is not.

Changelog
=========

Well, you know. Just higher level than `git log`.

About the project
=================

Repeat how to install, tell where to find the source, how to report bugs,
submit patches, contact the authors.
