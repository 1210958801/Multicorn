        The vorbis format allows a lot of things for tagging. It is possible to
        add any label you want and, for each label, to put several values.
        Because of that, this module cannot guarantee a set of
        properties. Despite this, here are some common tags you can use:
        - time_length : duration in seconds
        - _content : raw ogg/vorbis data
        - artist
        - genre
        - track
