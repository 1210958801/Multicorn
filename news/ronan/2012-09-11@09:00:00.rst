Multicorn 0.9.1 - 0.9.2
-----------------------

Today have been released the 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 releases of multicorn.

0.9.1 marks the last release of Multicorn for PostgreSQL 9.1, while 0.9.2 is the
first release of Multicorn for  PostgreSQL 9.2.

The numeration scheme changes for that reason.

The 0.9.2 major featur is the ability to influence the planner by informing it
of possible parameterized paths.

See the `Implementor's guide`_ for more information about this feature.
