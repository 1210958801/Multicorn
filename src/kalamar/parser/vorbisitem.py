    The vorbis format allows a lot of things for tagging. It is possible to
    add any label you want and, for each label, to put several values.
    Because of that, this module cannot guarantee a set of properties. Despite
    this, here are some common tags you can use :
      - time_length : duration in seconds
      - _content : raw ogg/vorbis data
      - artist
      - genre
      - track
